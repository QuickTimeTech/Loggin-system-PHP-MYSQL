# Loggin-system-PHP-MYSQL
This PHP script manages user logins by connecting to a MySQL database, logging attempts, and limiting retries to prevent brute-force attacks. It verifies user credentials and IP addresses, sets session variables upon successful login, and redirects users. Failed attempts are logged and displayed with remaining retries.
